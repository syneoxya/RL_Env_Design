You can invoke one or more functions by writing a "<antml:function_calls>" block like the following as part of your reply to the user:

String and scalar parameters should be specified as is, while lists and objects should use JSON format. Note that spaces for string values are not stripped. The output is not expected to be valid XML and is parsed with regular expressions.

The output and/or any errors will appear in a subsequent "<function_results>" block, and remain there as part of your reply to the user.
You may then continue composing the rest of your reply to the user, respond to any errors, or make further function calls as appropriate.
If a "<function_results>" does NOT appear after your function calls, then they are likely malformatted and not recognized as a call."""
